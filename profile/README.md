🙋‍♀️ This organization is created to help LLVM researchers to learn LLVM (and Clang, Compiler-RT, etc) easier. We would collect LLVM-related websites, tutorials, libraries, utilities, etc.

🌈 _Any forms_ of contributions are all welcome! Specially, you can [create a PR from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork), or [become a regular member](https://github.com/learn-llvm/.github/issues/1).
